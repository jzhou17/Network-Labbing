                AOS-CX 6300 Switch
                <br>
                <br>
                <u>Goal:</u>
                <br>
                Create 2 WLANs on the 6300M switch. One will be an Employee WLAN and
                the other will be an IoT WLAN. They should be on different networks 
                and neither should be on the AP management network (That's bad practice).
                <br>
                <br>
                On the IoT network, they should not be able to contact any devices on 
                the private/internal network. The only access they should have is the 
                Internet. The Employee WLAN can have access to any internal resources 
                and the Internet, except gaming and sports related websites.
                <br>
                <br>
                Note, you cannot configure anything beyond the 6300M switch.
